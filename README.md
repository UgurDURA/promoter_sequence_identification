Understand how promoter DNA sequences direct transcription

Understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms of gene expression is crucial in molecular biology. Promoter regions, especially core promoters, play a vital role in transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have revealed the diversity and complexity of core promoters, with various functional motifs contributing to their unique characteristics. Transcriptional cofactors (COFs) mediate regulatory signals between enhancer regions and core promoters, influencing gene expression.

Leveraging deep learning, we developed a novel model to predict COF preferences from DNA sequences, aiming to uncover the underlying DNA motifs that shape COF-promoter specificities. The results of the models demonstrated their effectiveness in predicting TSSs (Transcription Start Site) and providing insights into COF-promoter interactions. Deep learning methods proved valuable in deciphering the complex interplay between DNA sequences and transcriptional regulation.

This research contributes to our understanding of the relationship between DNA motifs and gene expression activity.
