Understand how promoter DNA sequences direct transcription

Understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms of gene expres-
sion is crucial in molecular biology. Promoter regions, especially
core promoters, play a vital role in transcriptional regulation. Re-
cent studies have revealed the diversity and complexity of core pro-
moters, with various functional motifs contributing to their unique
characteristics. Transcriptional cofactors (COFs) mediate regula-
tory signals between enhancer regions and core promoters, influ-
encing gene expression. Leveraging deep learning, we developed a
novel model to predict COF preferences from DNA sequences, aim-
ing to uncover the underlying DNA motifs that shape COF-promoter
specificities. The results of the models demonstrated their effec-
tiveness in predicting TSSs (Transcription Start Site) and providing
insights into COF-promoter interactions. Deep learning methods
proved valuable in deciphering the complex interplay between DNA
sequences and transcriptional regulation. This research contributes
to our understanding of the relationship between DNA motifs and
gene expression activity.
